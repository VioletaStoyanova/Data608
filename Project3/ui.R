# HW3
# 1. As a researcher, you frequently compare mortality rates from particular causes across 
# different States. You need a visualization that will let you see (for 2010 only) the crude 
# mortality rate, across all States, from one cause. For example, Neoplasms, which are effectively
# cancers. Create a visualization that allows you to rank States by crude mortality for each cause
# of death.
